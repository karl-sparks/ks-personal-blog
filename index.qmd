I am a AI enthusiast and data expert. I am currently a Principal Analyst at the [Australian Prudential Regulation Authority](https://www.apra.gov.au) where I generate insights and create data tools.

Previously, I worked at the [Reserve Bank of Australia](https://www.rba.gov.au) where I maintained the RBA's banks' funding model and undertook economic and financial research.
